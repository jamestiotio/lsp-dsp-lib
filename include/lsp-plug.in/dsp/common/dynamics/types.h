 * Compressor knee is a curve that consists of three parts:
 *   1. Part with constant gain amplification in the range [-inf .. start] dB
 *   2. Soft compression knee in the range (start .. end) dB present by the quadratic function (2nd-order polynom)
 *   3. Gain reduction part in the range [end .. +inf] dB present by the linear function (1st-order polynom)
 *
 * The typical algorithm of computing the compressor's curve:
 *   1. Take absolute value of the sample: x = fabfs(in)
 *   2. If x <= start then return gain*x
 *   3. Compute the natural logarithm of the x: lx = logf(x).
 *   4. If x < end then compute the gain using the 2nd-order polynom: gain = (herm[0]*lx + herm[1])*lx + herm[2]
 *   5. Otherwise compute the gain using the 1st-order polynom: gain = tilt[0]*lx + tilt[1]
 *   6. return expf(gain) * x
